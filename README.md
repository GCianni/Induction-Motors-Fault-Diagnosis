# Induction Motor Fault Diagnosis 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predict motor failure based on its vibration.
The model is based on Bagging mataclassifier and its metaheuristics on Genetic Algorithms.

The dataset used is made by Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) SMT Research Lab [1]
